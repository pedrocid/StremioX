## 0.2.44 - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- Torrents no longer take the streaming server down. A torrent streams from the local server, which already buffers the file, so the player's large read-ahead was double-buffering it in memory until the system killed the app. Read-ahead is now sized to the source: small for local torrent playback, full for debrid and direct streams.

### Added
- Automatic performance mode for older Apple TVs. The app detects a memory-constrained Apple TV (the Apple TV HD) and switches to a lighter path on its own so the remote stays responsive: the play head updates less often, the moving backdrop is dropped on browse, and buffers are kept tight. Every Apple TV 4K is unaffected. Settable by hand under Settings, Appearance, Performance.

### Changed
- The Lite build's identifier is now `com.stremiox.tv.lite`, and the CI artifacts follow. Installing 0.2.44 Lite over the previous Lite build creates a fresh app rather than updating in place. The Full build is unaffected.

## 0.2.43 - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Watch Now picks the genuinely best source. Ranking now weighs file size (a bitrate proxy) and lossless audio (Atmos, TrueHD, DTS-HD), so it stops settling for a basic 4K from whichever add-on answered first.
- Smooth, predictable scrubbing. Holding to seek glides across the timeline at an even pace instead of jumping by varying amounts.

### Fixed
- Audio reaches the TV and soundbars over HDMI eARC. The player now claims a movie-playback audio session, which fixes setups with no sound and lets multichannel audio reach a receiver.
- In Settings and the profile editor, pressing Down moves to the next row even when the focused item sits off to one side.

### Changed
- The slimmer Apple TV build is now StremioX Lite (it was StremioX Direct).

## 0.2.41 - 2026-06-11

A large consolidated release.

### Added
- Add to Library and Watch Later from any movie or series page and from Continue Watching.
- A Details action in the Continue Watching long-press menu.
- A stream-link QR code in the player to keep watching on your phone.
- A richer source list with size and quality per source, capped per add-on so one provider cannot bury the rest.
- An HDR and Dolby Vision compatibility toggle for displays that show a remux green or purple.

### Fixed
- Add-on torrents now receive the same TCP and TLS trackers as pasted magnets, so they can find peers where plain UDP discovery is blocked.
- The sources panel no longer freezes the player when opened.
- No more brief home screen flash before the profile picker on launch.
- Marking a whole series unwatched clears every episode tick.

## 0.2.35 - 2026-06-11

### Added
- A Direct Links Only mode and a separate lighter build (later renamed Lite) for debrid and direct links only.
- Per-series quality memory, so a series reopens in the quality you last played.
- HTTPS torrent trackers for peer discovery without UDP.

### Fixed
- Binge auto-next stays on the same release group, so quality never jumps mid-season.

## 0.2.24 to 0.2.27 - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Seamless watching: Continue Watching resumes the exact stream and position, the next episode is preloaded and warmed before the credits, and the embedded server wakes itself after sleep.
- A Relaunch button in Settings, playback speed, a live playback-info overlay, and a richer source picker.
- Paste any link to play it (magnet, direct URL, resolved debrid or usenet).

### Changed
- Profile PINs are stored as a salted hash and never shown.
- The update checker rechecks on a sensible schedule and surfaces new releases in Settings.

## 0.2.0 to 0.2.23 - 2026-06-09 to 2026-06-10

### Added
- The native Apple TV client on the engine: Home, Discover, Library, Detail, the full per-add-on source list, Search, and add-on management.
- Skip intro and outro from crowd-sourced timestamps merged with the file's chapters.
- The cinematic full-bleed redesign and the living backdrop on Home, Discover, and Library.
- The two-level quality picker and ranked Watch Now with instant preloaded auto-play next.
- Profiles: a "Who's watching?" picker, per-profile themes and history, an optional PIN, and per-profile accounts.
- Real HDR and Dolby Vision output, and the embedded streaming server for torrents.
- Brand identity, an animated splash, and QR sign-in.

### Fixed
- A device crash while a popular title's large source list loaded.
- A crash a fixed number of seconds into heavy 4K playback.

## 0.1.7.5 to 0.1.7.15 - 2026-06-08 to 2026-06-09

The player foundations.

### Added
- Smart audio and subtitle selection, language-grouped track pickers, subtitle styling and sync, and bundled fonts for every script.
- Long-press library menus, in-player source switching, and player auto-recovery on a stall.
- Eight accent themes plus a true-black OLED mode.
- Skip intro and outro from chapter markers, a seekable scrubber with hold-to-seek, and a screensaver hold-off during playback.
