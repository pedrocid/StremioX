///      candidates (the top items of the screen) cross-fades every `heroRotateInterval`.
///   2. **Click-to-feature** (override): tapping a poster pins it as the featured hero and PAUSES
///      rotation; tapping the already-featured poster (or the hero's Play button) opens its detail.
///
/// Each featured item is enriched with logo + trailer + synopsis through a SELF-CONTAINED meta
/// fetch (Cinemeta + installed meta add-ons), replicating the tvOS enrichment but kept entirely
/// inside SourcesiOS so the tvOS target is untouched. Enrichment is cached by id so re-showing a
